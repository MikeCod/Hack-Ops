<h1>Use After Free (UAF)</h1>

<h2>When does it appear ?</h2>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *buffer = NULL;
buffer = malloc(64);
free(buffer);
// The buffer don't point to NULL, there's a vulnerability
</code></pre>

<h2>What's the risk ?</h2>
<p>The next allocation can point to the area of the freed buffer, and thus the buffer can be used as valid with the data of the new buffer.</p>

<h2>How does the exploitation work ?</h2>
<p>If we control the new buffer, we can control the data of the freed buffer :</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *buffer = NULL;
char *new_buffer = NULL;

buffer = malloc(64);
free(buffer);

new_buffer = malloc(64);
strcpy(new_buffer, "Use After Free");
// buffer points to new_buffer address, thus its data will be interpreted as "Use After Free"
</code></pre>

<h2>How to patch it ?</h2>
<p>Point to NULL after freeing the buffer :</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">buffer = NULL;</code></pre>
